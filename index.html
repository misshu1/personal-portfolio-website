        <!-- About -->


        <h1 class="title">About</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>My first interaction with code was in 2009 when I created my first website, back then I was not thinking that I can do my living from it.</p>

        <p>Recently I saw an ad on Facebook about a scholarship program to learn web development. I read some information about that and I registered for the scholarship. One month passed and they announced the people selected for this program -- 60,000
            out of the 200,000 registered.</p>

        <p> The funny part of this is that I received an email telling me that I was not selected for this program, and I felt so bad in that day. But the very next day they send me a second email telling me that the first email was a mistake and I was selected.</p>

        <p>The scholarship start date came and , after a few weeks I’ve learned so much and was so motivated to learn more about programing, that I completed the 3 month scholarship program in only 1 month. The course was so well put together and the community
            always there to help when I got stuck in some quizzes.</p>

        <p> When the scholarship was over, the next step was to announce the recipients of a 6 months nanodegree program. That day was the longest day of my life. The email came telling me that I was one of the 10% of 60,000 people who moved on to phase 2
            of the scholarship -- 6 months of learning Front-End Web Development. It was the best thing that happened to me, and for this I want to thank Udacity for showing me a path to follow, that I had not seen before, and did not know existed.</p>
